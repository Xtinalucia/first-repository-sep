<p>This Chicago based band I've liked since the 90's and early 2000's. 
I felt they had a good combination of hard and soft music with interesting lyrics. 
<br>Their drummer is underrated and their lead singer/guitarist lived in what looked like a

<P>Tijs Michiel Verwest is hailed as the Godfather of EDM and I've only recently discovered his music. While working the first concert of the year I saw him play live and fell in love. It never fails to put me in a good mood and give me energy. </P>

        <p>Travel isn't about  collecting places been'on a map but rather living like others for a time and photographing whats around you. Savoring the seemingly insignificant moments:
             unfamiliar smells, flavors and sounds is really living.  </p></li>

<p>Afrikaans is the daughter language of Dutch and though not spoken by very many people I've found it so intriguing. Originally I just wanted to undersand certain Rugby players like (

<li>I  am interested in becoming a Web Developer because I enjoy learning how things are put together, building websites and lastly for the freedom. The work load at previously held jobs caused me to pivot in new direction. I look forward  to working in a career with a more reasonable amount of responsibilities. I have been a student at UIC studying Psychology and the sciences. Originally I had been interested in a computer forensics program at my local community college but was told they were restructuring the program and subsequently not accepting any new students. 
    Now I am finally able to persue learning more about computer coding.
